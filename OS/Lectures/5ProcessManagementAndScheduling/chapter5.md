### A multi-tasking/multi-programmed system is able to run multiple jobs simultaneously.

### The management of the jobs to ensure the highest CPU efficiency is done by the Process Manager/Scheduler.

### This topic looks into the tasks involved and a view of the algorithms used in the process.

Wikipedia: Process States http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_%28computing%29
This chapter introduces process states. You learn to differentiate between a program and a process and how the process is transferred into the running state.

Wikipedia: Process Management http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_%28computing%29
This topic covers how processes are managed by the Operating System. You will learn the 5 states a process may go through when executed by the CPU.

Wikipedia: Scheduling Algorithms http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_algorithm
In our module, we will have an overall view of scheduling algorithms, how they work and evolve through Operating Systems. We will only look at the following: FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RR and priority scheduling

William Stallings: Animations for Scheduling

William Stalling is the author of a number of Operating Systems text books. Here are some animations for Operating systems, collected by William Stallings.

You should pay particular attention to ONLY the following for this chapter
Chapter 3 - Process Description and Control
Chapter 9 - Uniprocessor Scheduling

Here is a second alternative reading to help you understand what are scheduling algorithms and how they are used.

CPU Scheduling Simulator http://www.acxe12.net/diplom/
This is a nice CPU simulator which can help in verifying your tutorial questions as well as give you an overall view of how each algorithm works

Process Scheduling Simulation http://www.utdallas.edu/~ilyen/animation/cpu/program/prog.html

Here is another simulator, written in Java, which allows you to enter the different values of the arrival times and process requirements.
