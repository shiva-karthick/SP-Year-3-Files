[Wikipedia: Deadlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock)
We are only going to have an overview of how deadlocks occur and how they can be prevented. This article should be a sufficient guide to this topic.

[Deadlock Tutorial](http://www.wiziq.com/tutorial/481-Operating-Systems-OS)
Here is a more comprehensive tutorial on deadlocks. Notice the same type of diagrams etc. We have taken our notes from the same reference book (Tanenbaum).
This tutorial is pretty deep, you are not required to go to that depth for this topic.
Only read this if you are truly interested and at your own peril!

[Deadlock Lecture](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs3013/c07/lectures/Section07-Deadlocks.pdf)
Here is the deadlock lecture from Department of Computer Science - Worcester Polytechnic Institute from an Operating systems module. The lecturer carefully explains the math behind the problem and a truly extensive and detailed coverage of how deadlocks can be detected and prevented. Again, Tenenbaum, is the reference.

Again, read this at your own peril! We do not need to go so deep into the topic. All we need to understand is what is a deadlock, how it can occur, how can we detect it and how can we prevent it.
